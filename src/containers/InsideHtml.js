        <a>Things to know before kick-starting your website</a>
        <p>
        To develop a completely functioning website, you need to get familiar with some of the basic requirements.
        </p>
        <ol >
          <li>You need a web host.</li>
          <li>You need a Domain name (Where people will find you).</li>
          <li>You need a website builder or a CMS solution (For managing the content on your website).</li>
        </ol> 
        <a>Finding a web host</a>
        <p>Finding a web host is the first step towards creating a website. It may appear to be frightening, but it isn't. Itâ€™s quite simple like hosting your files on your computer. But instead of a computer, if your files are hosted by a web server, anybody with an internet connection will have access to them. </p>
        <p>You don't have to manage your own server because there are hosting companies providing space on their servers for your website. The cost of reliable and affordable web hosting for new websites ranges from $3 to $10 per month.</p>
        <p>However, before going with a particular web host, there are three primary factors that you must consider and these will be covered by all reputable web hosting providers. Just make sure you don't choose a shady one.</p>
